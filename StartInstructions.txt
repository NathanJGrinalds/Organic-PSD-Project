This document outlines how to get started measuring data on a PSD.

1. Installing Python

Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3122/ and download the latest version of Python.
Alternatively, if Python is already installed, use CMD to type "python --version". This code was run
and tested using Python 3.11.1

2. Install packages

The data collection script uses PyMeasure, PyVisa, and NumPy, while the data viewing script uses MatPlotLib and Seaborn.
Use "pip install ---" to install each of pymeasure, numpy, and matplotlib. PyVisa should install with PyMeasure, and
Seaborn should install with MatPlotLib. You can use "pip list" to ensure each are installed.

Package            Version
------------------ ----------
matplotlib         3.7.0
numpy              1.24.2
PyMeasure          0.13.1
PyVISA             1.14.1
seaborn            0.13.2

3. Install Candle

Go to https://docs.sainsmart.com/article/7c20d7zaw3-how-to-install-candle-grblcontrol-for-windows and follow step 2 for
Software "Installation". This is the only step that I followed to get Candle working with the G-Code motors. However, if
you have any issues, try following instructions 1-3.

Once you have Candle open, try connecting the USB from the setup and jogging the motors to make sure everything is working.
Since we only have the X and Z motors, only the left/right and gray up/down arrows will actually move anything. In settings,
note which port you are connected to (e.g. COMX).

4. Install Keysight Connection Expert

Go to https://www.keysight.com/us/en/lib/software-detail/computer-software/io-libraries-suite-downloads-2175637.html and 
install the Keysight Instrument Control Bundle. This is what I personally used to install the Keysight Connection Expert,
but the bundle also includes BenchVue and other programs which should not be necessary. 

This program will be used to ensure your connection to the Semiconductor Parameter Analyzer (Agilent 4155C). Plug the
GPIB-USB cable into your computer and open the program. Under "My Instruments" > "GPIB-USB", there should be a green box
with an instrument labeled "4155C, Hewlett-Packard". Note the label under this name, which should look like 
"GPIB-::X::INSTR".


5. Edit information in the data collection file

In the data collection file, currently named "SnakeCollectData.py", set the variable GRBL_port_path to the
