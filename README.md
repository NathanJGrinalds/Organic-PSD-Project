# Organic-PSD-Project
Location for GCode files, SPA measurement scripts, and data analysis. 

The purpose of this repository is primarily to store code needed to execute GCode commands to servo motors, 
obtain current-voltage measurement using an Agilent 4155C semiconductor parameter analyzer, and to 
analyze and display the data obtained from organic position sensitive detectors (PSDs). 

This repository may also be updated to include code to train artificial neural networks trained on obtained 
data to improve the position sensing accuracy of the aforementioned PSDs.

Necessary libraries include -- PyVisa/PyMeasure, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, numpy, etc.
